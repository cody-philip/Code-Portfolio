# Code Portfolio

## [Zorkish](./Zorkish)
A simple text-based adventure frame. It uses simple text parsing to read in a text file which is then extrapolated into a text-based game. The purpose of this project was to develop more of an understanding of different programing archetectures.

## [Hunter AI](./HunterAI)
A python based application. Makes use of Pyglet to render an AI simulation of a hunter agent AI that will 'hunt' other non-hunter agents. There is limited interactivity by the user, such as switching between different modes, and increaseing certain variables such as speed and group cohesion based on the mode.
### Check-list of possible improvements
- Simplify commands
- Add in application guide
- Improve agent movements to be more reactive
- Add agent collision
- Add agent removal upon collision with hunter
